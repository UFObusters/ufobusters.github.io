# Setting of the scene
The era of data and the Web has not impeded the proliferation of reports on UFO sightings. All the contrary. Statements about incredible sightings are all over the Web. "The object was a brilliant white light standing out against the bright Arizona sky"


# Problem/Hurdle
Humans are naive and credulous by nature. They have always been. First it was chamans; then alchemists; then UFOs. Believing in the unkown is something intrinsic to humans. Nowadays, humans believe in fake news.


# Development
Recent technology developments, and the raise of accessible and widespread electronic devices, has changed this evidence supply mechanism. Most of these devices can record an comparatively high number of high resolution photographs and videos. In practice, this means that citizens from all social classes and incomes use these devices in their everyday lives. According to the popularity of the UFO phenomenon in past decades, one could have expected this technology spread make it easier to provide reliable evidence on the existence of UFOs.

Nevertheless, no such high resolution, multiple witness evidence has emerged as definitive proof of the existence of flying saucers.
Today we have 4k recording devices in our pockets. So the UFO thing is not a thing anymore.

People have switched from UFOs to fake news.

Even if certifiable fake statements on vaccination and rosevelt atopsy are debunked by its very authors,

believers want to believe. No evidence or debunk will ever convince them.

# Solution/Answer
The solution proves not trivial so far, but we devise two measures that could work as potential solutions to the problem: humor for the short term, and education for the long term.

Humor, ridiculization, and making charlatans out of the conversation could be a powerful humoristic way of countering the effects of fake news proliferators. The main advantage of these people is that they're way faster at creating the fake news than people debunking them scientifically.

(sort term solution) Ridiculizing, making them out of the conversation. There's no way to keep up on their pace (issuing fake news is faster than benuking them)
(long term solution) THE ANSWER IS EDUCATION.


# Glance at the future
And humans lived happy ever after.
